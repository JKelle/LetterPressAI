LetterPressCheater
==================

This program is designed to list the best possible moves for a person playing LetterPress, an iOS word game. (This program itself is NOT and iOS app.)
The program requires console input in the beginning: the letters on the board and, if the game has already been started, the current colors of the tiles.
The user can "play" a word by clicking one of the suggested boards or by clicking the letters on the main board then clicking "submit."

The console input is one string of length 25.
